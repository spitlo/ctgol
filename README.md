# Conway Twitty’s Game of Live

Conway Twitty’s Game of Live is an experiment in sequencing. It’s an evolving step sequencer that follows the rules of Conway’s Game of Life.

To help you place ticks, there are some keyboard modifiers. If you press `alt`/`option` while painting a tick, you will get a horizontal line. If you press `shift` while painting a tick, you will get a vertical line. Lines extend through all inactive ticks, so you can put a start and end tick and the line will cover the area between them. If you press `windows`/`command`/`meta` (depending on your OS) while drawing a line, the line will only paint every other tick.

You can mute individual tracks by using keys `a` to `z` on your keyboard. Or by clicking/tapping the track note.

You can enable kaleidoscope mode, either for the X axis, the Y axis, or both. This will mirror your ticks horizontally, vertically or both.

Conway Twitty’s Game of Live is some sort of sibling to [Space](https://spitlo.com/space/), [PIKSEQ](https://spitlo.com/pikseq/) and [/'siːkwənt/](https://spitlo.com/sikwent/). It’s an ever growing family of experimental sequencers!
